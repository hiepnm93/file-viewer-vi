# Ecosystem Packages

<div class="doc-kicker">Native Package Lines</div>

<p class="doc-lead">
  New integrations should prefer the standard <code>@file-viewer/*</code> packages.
  Historical <code>@flyfish-group/*</code> names remain available for existing users.

## Renderer Packages

Heavy renderers are split so applications can install only what they need:

- `@file-viewer/renderer-pdf`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-ofd`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-presentation`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-cad`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-typst`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-archive`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-email`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-ebook`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-text`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-image`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-media`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-mindmap`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-geo`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-drawing`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-3d`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-data`

## Compatibility Names

| Historical package | Prefer now |
| --- | --- |
| `@flyfish-group/file-viewer-web` | `@file-viewer/web` |
| `@flyfish-group/file-viewer3` | `@file-viewer/vue3` |
| `file-viewer3` | `@file-viewer/vue3` |
| `@flyfish-group/file-viewer` | `@file-viewer/vue2.7` |
| `@flyfish-group/file-viewer-react` | `@file-viewer/react` |

Compatibility packages keep old projects working, but new projects get clearer package names, better npm discoverability, and a cleaner upgrade path with the standard names.
